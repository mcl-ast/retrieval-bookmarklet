#Multnomah County Central Library Retrieval Bookmarklet Project

This is a bookmarklet I wrote for getting library item info from the web-based catalogs in JSON format.  This was developed specifically for requesting items from the library's closed stacks, and can be used in conjunction with an internal Google Docs form for staff to make such requests on behalf of patrons or for internal reasons.
